Basic hangman game themed as a popular 90s TV show Twin Peaks. Words to guess are taken from the show (mainly character names). Players can press any key to get started. The game displays a wins section for the number of times user guessed the word correctly. The word to guess is displayed with an underscore for each letter when the game starts. As the user guesses the correct letters, the game reveals them. For example, l a u _ a. The game also displays a number of guesses remaining and letters already guessed. After the user wins/loses the game, it automatically chooses another word and makes the user play it.
